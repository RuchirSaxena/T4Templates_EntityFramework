Introduction to .tt files & T4 Templates

What are .tt files?
.tt stands for T4Templates , if we want to write a 
class and in that class we have some properties like
P1,P2,P3,P4,.... , so the above class can also be created
by by writing a programming logic .tt files are nothing
but code generators , they generate the code automatically
by taking some programing language as input. The code is 
written inside text template file

Eg: Below is the example code 
public class MyClass

{

<# for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)

{#>

public int P<#= i#> { get; set; }

<# }#>

}

The above code created .cs file with below code

public class MyClass

{


public int P1 { get; set; }


public int P2 { get; set; }


public int P3 { get; set; }


public int P4 { get; set; }


public int P5 { get; set; }


public int P6 { get; set; }


public int P7 { get; set; }


public int P8 { get; set; }


public int P9 { get; set; }


public int P10 { get; set; }


}

The concept of .tt files are used in Entity Framework
// input(.txt) => .tt => .cs

// input(.edmx) => .tt => .cs

.tt files can also read data from .txt files

the .tt files are reading information from text and converting them
into code files ie..cs file

This concept is used in entity framework 5,6 is using to generate Model classes
from these .tt files

ie. as input they are reading .edmx file(XML File) readed by .tt files
and then they are generating .cs files 

// input(.edmx) => .tt => .cs
